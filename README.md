# Beem_AI_Chabot
This is an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist with customer support. The chatbot uses advanced language models to provide quick, helpful, and accurate responses to user queries. It is designed for businesses or platforms that need an automated solution for handling customer inquiries.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Responses:** Uses Groq and HuggingFace embeddings to power the chatbot's understanding and response generation.
- **Document-Based Knowledge:** The chatbot leverages stored documents (in `.txt` format) to provide context and relevant answers.
- **Vector Database Support:** Utilizes Chroma for storing and retrieving document embeddings.
- **Persistent Embeddings:** Embeddings are saved to disk, allowing for persistent data that is reused to avoid regeneration each time.
- **Query Handling:** The chatbot uses a templated prompt to generate concise, friendly, and informative responses based on user input.
